A decentralized application built with Solidity for the Ethereum Blockchain. It allows users to create and join accountability rings so that they are able to incentivize themselves to accomplish the longer term goals that can be hard to accomplish due to short term gain. This application was created as a final project for the Consensys Developer Bootcamp and is comprised of a web app front end and several Solidity smart contracts.
