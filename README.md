# accountability-rings
 Final project for Consensys Devbootcamp 2019-2020

<h1>Description</h1>
A decentralized application built with Solidity for the Ethereum Blockchain. It allows users to create and join accountability rings so that they are able to incentivize themselves to accomplish the longer term goals that can be hard to accomplish due to short term gain. This application was created as a final project for the Consensys Developer Bootcamp and is comprised of a web app front end and several Solidity smart contracts.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
It is hard to form new habits. In the famous [Stanford Marshmallow Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment), it is shown that children who are able to delay gratification also have better outcomes in life - from higher income to lower BMI to higher educational attainment. However, [willpower is weak](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/15/16863374/willpower-overrated-self-control-psychology) and our brains evolved to [value short term gain over long term threats](https://news.stanford.edu/features/2015/decisions/evolution.html).
