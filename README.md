# Accountability Rings

A decentralized application built with Solidity for the Ethereum Blockchain. It allows users to create and join accountability rings so that they are able to incentivize themselves to accomplish the longer term goals that can be hard to accomplish due to short term gain. This application was created as a final project for the Consensys Developer Bootcamp and is comprised of a web app front end and several Solidity smart contracts.

## Inspiration
It is hard to form new habits. In the famous [Stanford Marshmallow Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment), it is shown that children who are able to delay gratification also have better outcomes in life - from higher income to lower BMI to higher educational attainment. However, [willpower is weak](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/15/16863374/willpower-overrated-self-control-psychology) and our brains evolved to [value short term gain over long term threats](https://news.stanford.edu/features/2015/decisions/evolution.html).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
